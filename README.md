# STM32-VVVF-Inverter
A project than aims to recreate the sounds of trains with VVVF AC propulsion by running an actual motor using an STM32F446RE Nucleo microcontroller.
# Supported Hardware
STM32F446RE Nucleo
Other boards would likely work but have not been tested.
# Circuit Schematic
Currently a work in progress
# Terms of Use
You are free to use any of the code for non commercical use but please don't post modified code without referencing the project page.
# Disclaimer
This code currently is highly experimental and likely to have bugs.
Although working with just the microcontroller is pretty safe, the circuitry for the inverter contains high voltage which could be dangerous. Use at your own risk.
